E. PRESIDENT J. A. KUFUOR AT\\nPARLIAMENT ONÂ Â Â FEBRUARY 14TH, 2008.\\nÂ Â \\nINTRODUCTION\\nMR. Speaker, for the 8th and final time, I have come before this august House, in accordance\\nwith the Constitution of the 4th Republic, to give Honourable Members an account of the State\\nOf The Nation .\\nÂ Â \\nToday is National Chocolate Day. It is also Valentine Day, the day of love. Mr. Speaker,Â Â Â I should\\nassure you that I did not choose the day for my address. Should I call it a manifestation of the\\nlove between the Executive and the Legislature?Â Â On my part, I will say fate brought me here\\nbecause I want to leave this House with an effusion of love for both sides of the divide. So, in\\nthat spirit of love, let me wish each of you a Happy Valentine Day. Consult with the leadership\\nof the House to ensure adequate supply of the food of loveâ\\200\\220Â our own chocolate.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, when I was preparing this address, my attention was drawn to some speculations\\non the comparative performances between this government and previous regimes. Such\\nspeculations, Mr. Speaker, are futile. To me, it is useless to pretend to be the inventor of the\\nwheel. Rather, the mark of the successful leader is what to do with the wheel that one finds.Â Â \\nMy account will therefore be restricted to the State of the Nation as I found it on my\\nassumption of office, and how it has influenced the decisions and policies that I have\\nenunciated in my bid to better the nation. So, what I say today should not be thought of as an\\nattempt at belittling whatÂ Â Â  others did. Rather, it should be appreciated as a report of my\\ngovernmentâ\\200\\231s performance over the past seven to eight years in office, to improve the\\nconditions of our people. My abiding principle has always been to leave a place better than I\\nfound it.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, on balance, Ghana has been doing progressively well under my watch, and\\nenjoying tremendous goodwill both from within and from the international community, as a\\nresult of the performance of the government over the past seven years.\\nÂ Â \\nSince the commencement of the Golden Jubilee celebrations last year, the pulse of the nation\\nhas become very vibrant and the peopleâ\\200\\231s outlook positive and upbeat. Increasingly, Ghanaians\\nare displaying a strong yearning to be the best or with the best in Africa , as was manifested\\nclearly during the justâ\\200\\220ended soccer Tournament. Ghana did not lift the trophy as we had all\\nwished, but the country should be proud of winning the bronze and, above all, for hosting an\\nexciting and successful soccer fiesta adjudged by many of the continentâ\\200\\231s football officials and\\nenthusiasts to be the best so far in the history of the Tournament.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, the House will be happy to learn that new FIFA rankings were released just\\nyesterday, with Ghana ranked first in Africa and 14th in the world. This is the first time ever that\\nGhana has been ranked this high in the FIFA listings.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nLet me therefore use this occasion to congratulate the Black Stars and the technical team for\\ndoing their best and for being good sportsmen, and the Local Organizing Committee for their\\ncontribution. I should also acknowledge the unalloyed support which Ghanaians gave to the\\nStars and the patriotism they displayed so passionately in the country.\\nÂ Â \\nOf course, I am not forgetting governmentâ\\200\\231s initiatives in bidding for the tournament and also\\nthe investment in the beautiful stadiums of which we are all so proud. But even as we pat\\nourselves on the back, let us not forget that maintaining structures and expanding the facilities\\nto all regional capitals should be the responsibility of present and future governments and\\nsociety.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nTHE MACROâ\\200\\220ECONOMY\\nMr. Speaker with the budget already presented and all the details of national policy clearly\\narticulated, I propose only to give an overview of the period since 2001, and what remains to be\\ndone.Â Â  Let me begin with a focus on the macroâ\\200\\220economy which has been one of the major\\npreoccupations of government since it assumed office.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, you will recall that in 2001, the nation was forced by difficult circumstances to\\nmake the most pragmatic but by no means popular choice of adopting the HIPC Initiative.Â Â Â The\\nundeniable truth was that the country was broke. It could not sustain the servicing of its debts.\\nÂ Â \\nThe economy was also entrapped by incredibly high levels of inflation of over 40% and interest\\nrates of over 50%. The Cedi was in a dangerous free fall while TOR was smarting under crushing\\ndebts that had caused it to be blackâ\\200\\220listed and refused supplies by its regular suppliers.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, the progress recorded in the past 7 years has proved beyond doubt that the\\ndecision â\\200œto go HIPCâ\\200\\235 was a master stroke. Ghana is now solvent and the economy is strong and\\nresilient. The greatest litmus tests of this are:\\nÂ Â \\nâ\\200¢ The successful and spectacular issuance of a Euroâ\\200\\220bond on the London Stock Exchange\\nto raise USD750 million for infrastructural development. This bond was overâ\\200\\220subscribed\\nby over USD3billion, and this was Ghanaâ\\200\\231s first attempt ever on the market.\\nÂ Â \\nâ\\200¢ The ability to withstand the heavy shocks of the price of crude oil which has been skyâ\\200\\220\\nrocketing since last year, from USD50 to USD100 per barrel.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nâ\\200¢ The prompt rallying to the aid of the numerous victims of the unprecedented flooding in\\nthe Northern and parts of the Western Region last year.\\nÂ Â \\nâ\\200¢ The dramatic reâ\\200\\220denomination of the Cedi without incident. You will all remember that\\nthe old Cedi exchanged 10,000 to one dollar. With this exercise now, the Cedi exchanges\\nconfidently for one dollar and some cents.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nâ\\200¢ The flocking in of many reputable banks and the commencement of International\\nFinancial Services (Offshore Banking) in the country, in collaboration with Barclays Bank.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nâ\\200¢ The World Bankâ\\200\\231s rating of Ghana as the most attractive place to do business in the\\nemerging markets.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, these achievements are the results of wellâ\\200\\220implemented policies and adherence\\nto fiscal and monetary disciplines which are now the hallmark of the economy.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nFurther evidence of the consistent progress is that the GDP, even in the face of many\\ndifficulties, has moved beyond 6.5% currently, and is expected to pass the 8% mark within the\\nnext 3 years.\\nÂ Â \\nWith this trend, the country should be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of\\nreducing poverty by half ahead of schedule. A socially sensitive development framework is\\nalready in place. Mr. Speaker, we must build on it to promote widely shared growth which will\\ncome to reflect in the pockets of the people generally.\\nÂ Â \\nOil Discovery\\nBut, Mr. Speaker, the biggest blessing of the Jubilee year is the discovery of oil in commercial\\nquantities estimated to be over 3billion barrels, while prospecting continues. Proceeds from the\\nfind should impact the economy within the next two to three years.Â Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nIn the mean time, I have set up a Ministerial committee to work towards the development of\\nappropriate policies and measures, especially a regulatory framework which will make the\\nsector profitable for the entire society. With proper management of the find, the country\\nshould be free from the inadequate liquidity which has been a major constraint to effective\\ndischarge of development programmes. Additionally, the countryâ\\200\\231s dependency on external\\ndonor support would be reduced, thereby strengthening the selfâ\\200\\220confidence of the nation and\\npeople.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, you will recall that in this very House, government announced a programme of\\nfive priorities, namely, the following;\\nÂ Â \\nâ\\210\\231Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Vigorous infrastructural development\\nâ\\210\\231Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Modernized agriculture centred on rural development\\nâ\\210\\231Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Enhanced social services delivery, with special emphasis on education and health\\nâ\\210\\231Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Good governance\\nâ\\210\\231Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Private Sector development\\nÂ Â \\nFor the past seven years government has worked hard to achieve these priorities.\\nÂ Â \\nHUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT\\nEducation\\nMr. Speaker, Human Resource Development should be the natural starting point for the\\nknowledgeâ\\200\\220based society to which this nation aspires in order to mainstream itself into\\nglobalization.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, on assumption of office, I found the countryâ\\200\\231s education system in a parlous\\ncondition. From 2001, using resources from the HIPC Fund, Budget Allocation and the GETfund,\\ngovernment launched a programme to rehabilitate broken down educational institutions from\\nbasic through secondary to tertiary level. Other initiatives which have been implemented\\ninclude the Capitation Grant, the School Feeding Programme and improved studentsâ\\200\\231 loan\\nschemes, all of which have contributed to increase intake of pupils and students.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker,Â Â on account of Ghanaâ\\200\\231s School Feeding progrmme, I was invited to address the\\nCouncil of the World Food Programme in Rome just about a week ago. Together with a group of\\npupils from Ghana , I told the Ghana story. So, Mr. Speaker, Ghanaâ\\200\\231s School Feeding\\nProgramme has become a model for other developing nations around the world.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nLadies and Gentlemen, these policies that I have mentioned have all been captured within the\\nnew Educational Reform Programme, which started on schedule last September, with some\\nnovel features. The implementation of the constitutional provision of Free Compulsory\\nUniversal Basic Education (FCUBE) has been launched with this programme, so that from the\\nage of four to sixteen, all Ghanaian children must stay in school at the expense of the state.Â Â For\\nthose who do not continue to Senior High School, opportunity will be given for one year state\\nsponsored apprenticeship programme to acquire an employable skill.\\nÂ Â \\nAt the Senior High School, four main streams will run: academics, agriculture, technical and\\nvocational. Special emphasis will be given to Science, Mathematics and Technology including\\nICT. But running through all levels will be ICT training without which one cannot be said to be\\nfully literate these days.Â Â \\nMr. Speaker, since the First Republic, various educational programmes have recognized the\\nneed for Science and Technology but have not sown the seed for inculcating the essential\\ndisciplines in our people. What this government seeks to do at all levels is to acculturate science\\nin them, so that by the time they leave school, their mindset and outlook will reflect an\\nappreciation of Science and Technology as a way of life.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, as part of the Reform, all the 38 Teacher Training Colleges are being upgraded into\\ndiploma awarding institutions, across the curricula of learning, from Science through Arts and\\nICT. Further, 15 of them have been designated science colleges to be steeped even deeper in\\nthese subjects to provide specialist education for Science, Mathematics and Technology\\nteachers. Technical and Vocational Studies are also being highlighted in the Reform.Â Â \\nGovernment policy is to build Vocational and Technical institutes in every district, so the youth\\nwill learn to use not only their mind, but their hands as well.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nA Distance Education programme has been laid on for the upgrading of teachers beyond the\\ndiploma level. Improved conditions of service are part of the incentives to motivate teachers to\\ndeliver quality service. This government is fully committed to the concept of quality teaching as\\nthe guarantee for molding our youth into being high achievers, with technical and scientific\\nframe of mindset. Additional to refurbishing the Universities and Teacher Training Colleges ,\\ngovernment policy is to attract and retain young qualified faculty through scholarships, better\\nremuneration and conditions of service, sabbaticals and other incentives.Â Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, happily for our nation the burden that used to rest solely on the state for\\nprovision of tertiary education is being lessened by rapidly increasing private tertiary\\ninstitutions, some of which are proving very competitive in terms of quality of programme\\ndelivery and student intake.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nI must commend the founders of these institutions as well as the National Accreditation Board\\nfor their part in the process. My appeal is that the curricula of these private institutions should\\nexpand beyond religion, business and social sciences into Mathematics, Science and\\nTechnology, in line with governmentâ\\200\\231s new educational policy.\\nÂ Â \\nHealth\\nMr. Speaker, integral to Human Resource Development and the achievement of the UNâ\\200\\231s\\nMillennium Development Goals is a robust health delivery programme.Â  Â For this reason,\\ngovernment has seen to the rehabilitation of the Regional hospitals and district health posts;\\ncapacity building within the sector and improvement in the conditions of service of health\\nworkers.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nCurrently, the main driving force of health delivery is captured in the adage â\\200œprevention is\\nbetter than cure.â\\200\\235 Accordingly, the focus is on disease prevention and promotion of healthy\\nlifeâ\\200\\220styles that include healthy eating, both at home and in schools; physical exercise, use of\\npotable water and environmental cleanliness.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nWater\\nMr. Speaker, to provide safe water for good health, government policy has involved provision\\nof boreâ\\200\\220holes and handâ\\200\\220dug wells as well as major rehabilitation works on urban water supply\\nsystems. These are ongoing in all the regions. They include Accraâ\\200\\220Weijaâ\\200\\220Kpong loop which is\\nunder construction and will be completed within this year to bring great relief, the Kwanyaku\\nWater Supply Expansion Project, the Capeâ\\200\\220Coast Water Supply Expansion Project (to draw\\nwater from Sekyere Heman) and the Tamale Water Expansion Project, the Kumasi Water Supply\\nProject, and the Koforidua water supply project. Plans for Sunyani are almost completed. This is\\nexpected to radically tackle the waterâ\\200\\220borne diseases plaguing many parts of the country.\\nÂ Â \\nThe National Health Insurance Scheme\\nMr. Speaker, the National Health Insurance Scheme is a major contribution of this government\\nto provide quality and affordable health care. At the moment over 9,000,000 individuals,\\nrepresenting 48% of the population, are full members of the scheme.Â Â  At this rate, it is\\nenvisaged that in the five years, all Ghanaians should be covered. A special feature is that in\\nthree years all children below 18 will become automatic members of the scheme, not through\\ntheir parents as it is now.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nHIV/AIDS\\nMr. Speaker, the relentless fight against the spread of HIV/AIDS resulted in a modest reduction\\nfrom 2.6% prevalence level in 2006 to 2.2% in 2007. The voluntary counseling and testing\\nservices which are operating in 138 districts should make help more readily available to people\\nliving with the disease.Â Â  They should also help to contain the spread of the disease.Â Â  At the\\nmoment, 48 antiâ\\200\\220retroviral sites are operational in the country.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, there are other onâ\\200\\220going programmes to minimize the incidence and impact of\\nmalaria and guinea worm infestation, on the society. With improvement in water delivery it is\\nexpected that incidence of guinea worm infestation will be reduced.\\nÂ Â \\nINFRASTRUCTURE\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, a vigorous infrastructural development is being pursued to open up the whole\\ncountry to facilitate the movement of persons, goods and services, while promoting socioâ\\200\\220\\ncultural interaction.\\nÂ Â \\nRoads\\nMr. Speaker, the roads sector in particular is witnessing an incredible level of development\\nunprecedented in the history of this country. Every region and district boasts of completed and\\nonâ\\200\\220going roads of all grades, especially those linking farm gates to market centres.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, the difference is that specifications of the major trunk and arterial roads are much\\nimproved, with an expected time span of 20 years.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nThe strategic importance of cocoa is acknowledged through the Cocoa Roads Improvement\\nProject (CRIP). This year, USD100million has been released for a programme to tar or surfaceâ\\200\\220\\ndress some selected roads in 6 selected cocoa growing regions.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, all the arterial roads from Accra to the neighbouring countries of Togo , Cote\\nDâ\\200\\231Ivoire and Burkina Faso have undergone reconstruction. Work is onâ\\200\\220going in various\\nMetropolises, Municipalities, and district capitals to reduce traffic congestion, improve public\\ntransportation and support economic activities.Â Â Â Accra is a typical example of these â\\200“ Nkrumah\\nCircle â\\200“Ofankor, Tetteh Quarshie â\\200“ Aburi, Malam â\\200“ Kasoa and all over the country.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, since 2001,\\nâ\\200¢ over I,000 km of feeder roads have been surfaced nationâ\\200\\220wideÂ Â \\nâ\\200¢ About 4,800 km have undergone rehabilitation.\\nÂ Â \\nâ\\200¢ 10,000km have undergone spot improvement, whileÂ Â \\nâ\\200¢ 2,300 have been reâ\\200\\220graveled.Â Â \\nâ\\200¢ 84 bridges have been builtÂ Â \\nâ\\200¢ 500km of roadside drains have been constructed for all cities\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, sadly, the accident rate on these improved roads, even though falling, is still\\nunacceptable. I charge the Driver Vehicle Licensing Authority, the Road Safety Commission, and\\nthe Motor Traffic Unit to redouble their efforts to ensure that quality of driving on our roads\\nimproves.\\nÂ Â \\nRailways\\nMr. Speaker, after years of neglect, the railway sector is at long last receiving attention. In the\\ncourse of the year, rehabilitation of the network will commence, in partnership with the Private\\nSector. USD$90 million of the proceeds from the Euroâ\\200\\220bond is being used as leverage with a\\nconsortium so that the network which has not seen rehabilitation for the better part of the last\\ncentury. The plan is to extend the network all the way to the northern part of the country, and\\nis expected to generate thousands of jobs across the country and also revive some of the old\\nrailway towns.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nLet me use this opportunity to appeal to the squatters along the railway line to make\\narrangements to relocate before construction commences.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nPorts\\nMr. Speaker, both the Tema and Takoradi ports are undergoing various forms of rehabilitation\\nfor modernization and expansion. Partly due to this, the volume of freight with the sister\\nlandlocked countries in the sahel region has increased immensely. Governmentâ\\200\\231s intention is to\\nmake the countryâ\\200\\231s sea ports the preferred entreport in the ECOWAS subâ\\200\\220region.\\nÂ Â \\nAviation\\nMr. Speaker, thanks to the justâ\\200\\220ended Soccer Tournament, three regional airports in Takoradi,\\nTamale and Kumasi have been upgraded to enable them cope with bigger aircraft and flights\\naround the clock. Customs and immigration services are also available to support international\\nflights. During Ghana 2008, Tamale and Kumasi received 8 and 10 direct international flights\\nrespectively, while Takoradi received 14 through Kotoka.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nTelecommunication\\nMr. Speaker, government is endeavouring to make information and communication technology\\navailable to large sections of the society. The National Communications Backbone\\nInfrastructure network is being pursued vigorously to provide open access broadband\\nconnectivity. Through this, all Senior High Schools are being connected to the system to\\nfacilitate distance education programmes. Again, all sectors of our society including commerce,\\nhealth, and government will access information speedily for decisionâ\\200\\220making.\\nÂ Â \\nGovernment is also promoting a competitive Telecom Market to ensureÂ Â Â fairâ\\200\\220play among the\\noperators and higher quality and more affordable service delivery to the people. The\\nimportance of this is spreading information all over and introducing uniformity of standards and\\nvalues.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nENERGY\\nMr. Speaker, the energy sector has proved a challenge throughout the life of this administration\\nbecause of the very high cost of crude oil and the occasional drying up of the Volta .Â Â Last year,\\nafter the energy crisis which led to a countryâ\\200\\220wide loadâ\\200\\220shedding exercise, government\\nannounced a short to medium and longâ\\200\\220term energy policy to solve the problem once and for\\nall. The new policy involves a mix of thermal and hydro energy for electricity generation.Â Â With\\nthe success of the shortâ\\200\\220term measures, the loadâ\\200\\220shedding exercise was discontinued.\\nImplementation of the medium term policy is in progress, while the Bui Hydro Electric Project,\\nwhich is a longâ\\200\\220term measure, has started, completion is expected in 2012. Mr. Speaker,\\nsmaller dams are to be constructed on the Ankobra, Tano and Pra rivers, and negotiations are\\nonâ\\200\\220going with the contractors on the Bui project towards that end. I am confident that\\nsuccessful implementation of the policy will provide the countryâ\\200\\231s energy requirement for\\nIndustrialization.\\nÂ Â \\nThe West Africa Gas Pipeline\\nMr. Speaker, one of the legacies of this government is the West Africa Gas pipeline which is\\nnow completed. The first freeâ\\200\\220flow of nitrogen has been done. This Project is expected to\\nimpact positively on energy generation in the country since gas is a relatively cheaper source of\\nenergy than crude oil.\\nÂ Â \\nÂ Â \\nÂ Â \\nPRIVATE SECTOR\\nMr. Speaker, on assumption of office, I declared the ushering in of the Golden Age of Business,\\nhence the critical focus on the Private Sector which inherently, generates more employment\\nthan the Public Sector. Various laws and measures have been put in place to facilitate the\\nSectorâ\\200\\231s growth, including capacity building programmes, provision of government guarantees\\nas well as different forms of credit like the Venture Capital Fund, Microâ\\200\\220credit and Small Loan\\nScheme.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, the Private Sector is doing very well. I must acknowledge the substantial\\ninvestment which is now making its way into the economy, particularly from mining, services\\nindustry, commerce, tourism and hotel development. The financial sector, perhaps the most\\nvibrant, continues to do well, with an influx of many new banks, both local and foreign. In a\\nmonth, I should be launching the Central Bankâ\\200\\231s Eâ\\200\\220ZWICH system, which is modernizing the\\nfinancial system towards greater efficiency and security.Â Â Also, Mr. Speaker, the vigorous and\\nalmost miraculous developments in real estate which have become a feature countryâ\\200\\220wide are\\nmostly private sector initiatives. Government has stepped in with a housing scheme to help\\nworkers. The project is ongoing in Accra , Kumasi , Koforidua, Tamale and Wa. I commend the\\nprivate real estate developers highly for staying resolved in the face of high input costs. Mr.\\nSpeaker, there is the need to build greater entrepreneurial spirit to take advantage of the\\nexisting opportunities within the system. At the moment, a number of world class companies\\nare vying to partner the country to invest in the bauxite industry for both upstream and\\ndownstream processing locally.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nAgriculture\\nMr. Speaker, agriculture forms the biggest part of the private sector and employs the larger\\npopulation in the rural area. It is also the obvious sector to lead industrialization. Government\\nhas sought to modernize the sector through mechanization and irrigation to change the rural\\neconomy, create more wealth and help attain the Millennium Development Goals. So far, more\\nthan 3,000 tractors have been sold to farmers at highly subsidized rates. Small scale irrigation\\nprojects are also being promoted, especially in the northern parts of the country. Despite this,\\nmuch remains to be done to transform the sector, mainly because of outlook and also financial\\nconstraints. However, through various interventions including the supply of improved planting\\nmaterials, extension services and microâ\\200\\220credits to farmers, significant results have been\\nrecorded. Food has been available around the year at affordable prices.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nCommercial Farmers\\nMr. Speaker, the agricultural sector is attracting some large scale commercial farmers like\\nGolden Exotics Company Limited, which is the local subsidiary of the internationally renowned\\nFrench company, â\\200œCompagnie Fruitiere,â\\200\\235Â Â the Another company is the Blue Skies. These in turn\\nare attracting a number of satellite farms.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nCocoa\\nThe cocoa sector in particular registered the highest ever production level of over 740,000\\ntonnes during the 2005/2006 crop year. The target is to attain a million tons in the next couple\\nof years.\\nÂ Â \\nCurrently, governmentâ\\200\\231s policy is towards valueâ\\200\\220addition and is therefore welcoming both local\\nand foreign investors into the sector. At the moment over 30% of cocoa beans are processed\\nlocally by such world class companies as Barry Callebaut and Cargyll. Our own cocoa processing\\ncompany is also doing very well.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMillennium Challenge Account\\nMr. Speaker, under the Millennium Challenge Account, Ghana is the highest recipient of an\\namount of USD547 million. It may prove to be the longâ\\200\\220awaited opportunity to transform and\\nmodernize the rural economy through mechanization.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nUnder the programme, farmers in twentyâ\\200\\220three districts in five regions the country are being\\nassisted to undertake commercial agriculture, mainly in the cultivation of horticultural\\nproduce.Â Â Â The project is to serve as a model to other farmers and to promote best practices\\nfrom farms to the ports for export. Many ancillary jobs are expected to be created not only in\\nthe participating districts, but also throughout the country.Â Â Â Â Â Â \\nNational Youth Employment Programme\\nMr. Speaker, unemployment has bedeviled the nationâ\\200\\231s economic efforts. The search for\\neconomic growth is to expand opportunities for employment generation and job creation for\\nthe youth. Projections are that with the improving GDP the employment opportunities will\\nexpand. Mr. Speaker, in 2007, a total of 200,000 jobs were created. This was a major\\nimprovement over the 120,000 created in 2006.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, the stagnation in the economy caused a huge backlog of unemployment which the\\nrecovery of the economy is gradually resolving. In the formal sector, there is a steady growth in\\nemployment generation. In 2006, 120,000 jobs were created, while 200,000 jobs were created\\nin 2007. Some youth take up jobs in the informal sector which go unrecorded because of lack of\\nappropriate data. Mr. Speaker, on this score, I am happy to say that the national identification\\nprogramme is about to take off. The equipment is in; the offices are almost ready; training of\\npersonnel is about to start. By the end of this year, all residents of 16 years and above will have\\nphoto identification cards. By middle of next year, both Ghanaians and legally resident\\nforeigners will have their photo identification cards.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, the Youth Employment Programme is one key strategic intervention to engage the\\notherwise unemployed youth to prepare for more permanent job positions. Since the\\ninauguration of the programme, in October 2006, it has provided placements for over 108,000\\nyoung people.Â Â Given the transient nature of the placement and funding arrangement for them,\\nthe programme tends to suffer delayed payment of wages.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nI have directed the Ministers for Finance, and Manpower, Youth and Employment to ensure\\nthat funding for this programme is streamlined and sustained, to ensure regular and timely\\npayment of allowances.\\nÂ Â \\nI am happy to note however that the programme has attracted attention of sister African\\ncountries, the international development community as well as Ghana â\\200\\231s private sector, which\\nis proving to be a reliable partner in supporting the youth.\\nThe PUBLIC SECTOR\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, in the past, the public sector tended to stand aloof from the private sector.\\nGovernment is reforming it to be very professional and very supportive of the private sector.\\nThe new concept for development is public/private partnership. Government has initiated the\\nestablishment of the citizensâ\\200\\231 charter on all institutions to enhance responsiveness to the\\nprivate sector and to lock into place the partnership between the two. The first phase of the\\ncharter involves the land and revenue sectors.\\nPublic Sector Pay Reform\\nMr. Speaker, as part of the reform government is developing a comprehensive objective job\\nevaluation as the basis for establishing equity in public sector wage administration.\\nÂ Â \\nFair Wages and Salaries Commission\\nIn the same way, the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission has been constituted to ensure that\\npublic sector pay is administered with equity, fairness, and transparency, so as to minimize\\nlabour disputes over pay administration.\\nNATIONAL LABOUR COMMISSION\\nIn the face of the growth in the economy, the National Labour Commission should be even\\nmore up and coming in settling labour and industrial disputes using negotiation, mediation, and\\narbitration, as against confrontation.\\nÂ Â \\nI would like to take this opportunity to commend governmentâ\\200\\231s main social partners â\\200“\\norganized labour and employers, for displaying good faith in our relationship over the past\\nseven years.\\nÂ Â \\nGOOD GOVERNANCE\\nMr. Speaker, Ghana prides herself as a beacon of good governance.Â Â But as self assessment is\\never so suspect, we should be happy with the African Peer Review Mechanism which provides\\nexternal monitoring.Â Â Ghana was first to sign up to the APRM.\\nÂ Â \\nÂ Â \\nÂ Â \\nÂ Â \\nAPRM\\nWhen any country has been reviewed, the APRM requires periodic reports to focus on action\\nplans to remedy defects brought to light by the review.Â Â Accordingly, the latest report made to\\nthe Eighth Summit of the APR Forum on January 30, 2008 at Addis Ababa , highlighted action\\nplans for better governance, including the following:Â Â \\nÂƒ Stemming conflict arising from land disputesÂ Â \\nÂƒ Strengthening the oversight role of ParliamentÂ Â \\nÂƒ Establishment of trade desks in MDAs and capacity building for analyzing multilateral\\ntradeÂ Â issuesÂ Â \\nÂƒ Strengthening of tax administration\\nThe report was well received by the APR forum.\\nÂ Â \\nMr Speaker, we remain persuaded that the Africa Peer Review Mechanism provides us with a\\nmirror to undertake a reality check on good governance and on our collective wellâ\\200\\220being.\\nImplementation of the action plans reported to APR Forum has already commenced.\\nLaw and Order:\\nMr. Speaker, I am happy to report that the fight against corruption, which is an affront to good\\ngovernance, has found a new ally in Parliament. Last year saw the public hearings of the Public\\nAccounts Committee of Parliament for the first time. Some of the revelations were mindâ\\200\\220\\nboggling. I congratulate Parliament on the excellent job done. The Committeeâ\\200\\231s proactive\\nstance demonstrates appreciation that concerns about corruption are more helpful when they\\ngo beyond mere complaints. The Attorneyâ\\200\\220Generalâ\\200\\231s Department has set up an Antiâ\\200\\220Corruption\\nUnit to study the recommendations, to prosecute cases that need to be prosecuted.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nLaw Enforcement:\\nMr. Speaker, law and order also require enforcers in the right numbers proportional to the\\npopulation. In 2001, the Police SÂ Â Â Â ervice stood at 15,983. It has since gained by an additional\\n10,132. But compared to the UN ratio of Police to citizen at 1:500, Ghana currently reports a\\nratio of 1:994.Â Â Â Â Â While beefing up the numbers is receiving attention, resources lately provided\\nto the police include vehicles, communication equipments, ammunition and uniforms.\\nÂ Â \\nMr Speaker, in the past, communities could form volunteer units for community protection. It is\\nan idea worth revisiting. This, however, is no recommendation for instant justice which must be\\ncondemned in no uncertain terms.\\nÂ Â \\nGender:\\nMr Speaker, Ghana is making great strides towards a more inclusive society. Last year,\\ngovernment appointed the first female Chief Justice in the nationâ\\200\\231s history. We should be proud\\nthat the male stranglehold on the headship of the Judiciary has at long last been broken. In all\\nunits of the Public Service, both genders are represented at the top. There is representation\\nalso in all branches of the security services. Both Parliament and the Executive also have their\\nshare of gender mix, though balance is yet to be achieved.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr Speaker, it is for paying prompt attention to such underâ\\200\\220representation that the Ministry of\\nWomen and Children has been established. The Ministry is doing a good job already.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nForeign Relations\\nMr. Speaker, if I may now turn briefly to foreign relations, respect for our country shows in the\\nnumber of international conferences attracted here in recent times. In the next few days, we\\nexpect to host the President of the US , Mr. George Bush.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, Ghana was in the Chair in July last year when the AU engaged in the Great Debate\\non Africa â\\200\\231s future.Â Â  Subject to details still being worked out, the consensus was for a\\nContinental African Union Government in the foreseeable future. Sadly, there are still conflicts\\nand tensions that do not make anybody happy.Â Â  But no effort is being spared by the AU to\\nprovide remedies.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nRelations with our immediate neighbours were never better.Â Â It is a matter of national pride\\nthat in the last seven years, Ghana was elected twice as chair of the subâ\\200\\220regional body of\\nECOWAS.Â Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nLate last year when the European Union and Africa engaged each other to devise strategies for\\nmutual survival in the global market, Ghana as chair of A.U. was coâ\\200\\220chair with Portugal as chair\\nof the E.U.Â Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, I have been personally privileged to travel extensively representing Ghana ,\\nEcowas or the AU as chair. It has been a good experience for me, and I dare say it has earned\\ngood public relations around the globe for the country, for which we should all be proud.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nParliament:Â Â Â Â \\nMr. Speaker, the Legislature plays no small part in the drive for good governance. How well\\nequipped is the House for its critical role must be of concern to all of us. It is, indeed, a shame\\nthat our MPs do not have adequate office room or staff to assist their work. I recall that in my\\nvery first Sessional Address, I made a promise that the House would be provided adequate\\nresources for its work.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, I was aware at the time of a loan facility of USD 25 million waiting to be utilized. It\\nwas only later that I learnt that the loan had been diverted to an apparently more urgent\\npurpose by those who secured it. But I am happy to report that fresh resources are in hand for\\nthe refurbishment of Job 600 for use by MPs. The Speaker is aware of what the Executive is\\ndoing for the Legislature.\\nÂ Â \\nMr. Speaker, in future, the House might consider preparing a comprehensive budget of its\\nneeds for funding in the same way as the Judiciary does. In offering this advice to the House, I\\nam tempted to say it is because â\\200œI care for youâ\\200\\235. The reason should be obvious, because I was\\ntwice elected to the House. Indeed, Parliament is where I cut my political teeth some forty\\nyears ago.\\nÂ Â \\nNational Heritage:\\nMr. Speaker, it is an open secret that as President of the nation that attained independence 50\\nyears ago ahead of the pack in Black Africa, I commute to work from my own selfâ\\200\\220built home. Of\\ncourse, my home is not going to be available to the next President. On the other hand, the\\nCastle, a former slave post, is so unsuitable for residence that it should surprise no one that\\nnone of our Prime Ministers and Presidents of the past chose to live there full time. So, where\\nwill my successor live, if he has no suitable accommodation of his own?\\nÂ Â \\nMr Speaker, Flagstaff House is being rebuilt to accommodate the next President in dignity.\\nAdditionally, Peduase, Akomsombo and Akuse which were built in the First republic as\\nPresidential retreats have all been refurbished. Not for the vanity of the Presidency, these are\\nnational assets that deserve better than the neglect to which they have been consigned in the\\npast.Â Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr Speaker, not from the budget, and certainly not at the expense of anyoneâ\\200\\231s pet project, the\\nmoney for Flagstaff House has been sourced from soft loans repayable over a 25â\\200\\220year period,\\nwith a 5â\\200\\220year moratorium. Good things do not come better than that. Parliament should be\\nproud that at long last there is going to be an official residence for the President of our\\nRepublic.\\nÂ Â \\nSimilarly, Mr. Speaker, in the wake of Ghana 2008, the country now has four state of the art\\nstadiums in four regions.Â Â  It should be possible over time for each region to have one of its\\nown.Â Â Human resource development is better for such facilities which can also be exploited toÂ Â Â \\neconomic advantage.Â Â We must make use of them while enjoying ourselves.Â Â The point is that,\\nMr. Speaker, we do not have to solve all personal problems before we give ourselves the\\noccasional treat.\\nÂ Â \\nElection 2008\\nFinally, Mr Speaker, under the Constitution of the Fourth Republic , it is to be noted that no\\noffice, appointive or elective, may be encumbered forever by any one person. Ever so often, as\\nregulated by law, holders of elective office, as President or Member of Parliament, must seek\\nfresh mandate by submitting to election.\\nÂ Â \\nMr Speaker, in canvassing for any elective office, political parties have the machinery for\\nmarketing their favorite candidates for a choice to be made by the electorate. But it is\\nincreasingly becoming evident that some prefer the marketing strategy of presenting their\\nopponents in the worst possible light. I dare say they might do better, if they focused more on\\nwhat they would do different, if they received the peopleâ\\200\\231s mandate. Still, within the limits of\\nthe law, political parties may run their campaign in any manner that they choose.\\nÂ Â \\nMr Speaker, the electoral arrangements currently in place have been put to test four times\\nalready since 1992, with outcomes that have been endorsed as reflecting the true wishes of the\\npeople. Each election has thrown light on areas that need attention. Thus, we have progressed\\nfrom opaque to transparent ballot boxes; and from Voter ID Cards with no pictures to ones that\\nhave pictures. Polling Agents have acquired experience from each round of elections, and with\\ntraining could get better still. Onâ\\200\\220going work on National ID Cards has so progressed that\\nissuance of the Cards should be possible this year.\\nÂ Â \\nMr Speaker, the independent Electoral Commissioner appointed since 1993 remains at post.\\nStaff at the Commission include some who have also been at post since 1993. The Commission\\nhas received international commendation over the years for its neutrality and professionalism.\\nIndeed, It is much sought after in other countries to provide technical assistance. The\\nCommission can perform better still, with constructive criticism.\\nÂ Â \\nAbove all, Mr Speaker, there is the judiciary, another independent entity, whose intervention\\ncan be petitioned by any one who feels aggrieved. When there is so much going for our\\nelectoral process, there is no reason to contemplate extra measures for resolving imaginary\\nscenarios in the coming elections. Far from being at war, we are only going into elections, and\\nnot the first time, Mr Speaker.\\nÂ Â \\nCONCLUSION\\nMr. Speaker, in coming to the end of this address, I should remind the House that there is still a\\nlong list of unfinished business.Â Â But I do not want to begin a culture where a long catalogue of\\nthings yet be done becomes the basis for an extended term.Â Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nIn the period since 2001, government has focused on providing the platform for accelerated\\ngrowth.Â Â I believe that this has been largely achieved through macroâ\\200\\220economic stability.Â Â  The\\nnext phase of development should take us into industrialization, with attendant employment\\nopportunities and value addition to our raw materials, especially agricultural produce.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nAcquisition of Valco is also going to be especially critical to the industrialization phase of our\\ndevelopment. World class prospective investors give us hope that an integrated\\nbauxite/alumina to aluminium industry is possible, after all. This was the dream which inspired\\nDr. Kwame Nkrumah, the nationâ\\200\\231s first President to source money to build the Akosombo dam.\\nThat dream is within reach, Mr Speaker.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nThrough this august House, Mr Speaker, I want to thank all our compatriots for the opportunity\\ngiven me to serve as the countryâ\\200\\231s President for two terms. I want to thank especially my\\nfavourite political party, the New Patriotic Party, on whose ticket I stood, whose vision has been\\nthe source of my inspiration. I have no doubt that the partyâ\\200\\231s motto, â\\200œDevelopment in\\nFreedomâ\\200\\235, remains relevant. I dare say that because they know a good thing when they see it,\\nthe people of this great nation will return the NPP to power.Â Â \\nÂ Â \\nMr Speaker, I thank you and the House for receiving me.\\nMay God Bless you.Â Â Â "}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
